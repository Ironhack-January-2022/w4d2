## MongoDB

#### The database that we are using is MongoDB. MongoDB is a non-relational database that stores data in collections. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and over the time the data structure can change.

### Check if mongo is installed - this way you can also access the mongo shell

```bash
$ mongo
```

#### Terminology :

#### Database -> Collections -> Documents -> Fields

#### Documents are created using JSON format (or BSON - for binary json). They are key-value objects, so we need to specify both to create our first one.

Most common data types in mongoDB :

- type	Examples
- Double	3.141625
- String	“IronHack Coding Bootcamp”
- Date	“Sun Dec 08 07:15:44 UTC 2013”
- Boolean	true
- Object	{ foo: ‘bar’, }
- Array	[“apple”, “oranges”, “kiwis”]
- ObjectID	ObjectId(“52cdef7c4bab8bd675297d8a”)
- Null	null

## Mongo Queries

#### Import a JSON file into a collection


###  We wanna download a movies database

#### Download the file from here : https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/learning-units/movies.json.zip


```bash
// in the downloads directory
$ unzip movies.json.zip
$ mongoimport --db video --collection movies --file movies.json --jsonArray
```

#### Syntax of the import - you can also do it in compass directly

```bash
mongoimport --db <name of db> --collection <name of collection> --file <path of file>
```

### The database is now named video 

Documentation:
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/

### Queries
#### Basic query
#### { field: value}

#### { year: 1994 } will return all the documents in the movies collection with the value for year equal to 1994

#### { director: "Christopher Nolan" } will return all documents in the movies collection with the value for director equal to Christopher Nolan

#### { director: "Christopher Nolan", year: 2005 } will return all documents in the movies collection with the value for director equal to Christopher Nolan and the value for year equal to 2005

#### If you want to query for an object id, you should specify that in the querie because mongo
stores the object ids as type ObjectId. If you don't specify it, it will search for a string
{ "_id": ObjectId('someobjectid')}


#### Logical operators
### $and
#### { $and: [{ director: "Christopher Nolan" }, { year: 2005 }] }

### All filters passed to $and must match for a document to be returned.

### $or
#### { $or: [{ director: "Christopher Nolan" }, { year: 2005 }] } will return all documents in the movies collection that have either Christopher Nolan as director or 2005 as the year

#### At least one of the filters passed to $or must match for a document to be returned.

### $nor
#### { $nor: [{ director: "Christopher Nolan" }, { year: 2005 }] } will return all documents in the movies collection that have neither Christopher Nolan as director nor 2005 as year

### None of the filters passed to $nor must match for a document to be returned.

### Project
#### { year: 1, title: 1, _id: 0 } return only the year and title fields for the returned documents. By default every other field is set to 0 except for _id which is set to 1.

### Sort
#### { title: 1 } sort by ascending order of title.

#### { year: 1, rate: -1 } sort by ascending order of year and descending order of rate.

### Skip and Limit
#### Skips x documents and limits to y documents.

## More operators
### $ne
#### { year: { $ne: 1994 } } return all movies where the value for the year field is NOT EQUAL to 1994.

### $gt $gte
#### { year: { $gt: 1995 } } return all movies where the value for the year field is GREATER THAN 1995

#### { year: { $gte: 1995 } } return all movies where the value for the year field is GREATER THAN or EQUAL to 1995

### $lt $lte
#### { rate: { $lt: 8.5 } } return all movies where the value for the rate field is LESS THAN 8.5

#### {$and: [{ year: { $gte: 1990 } }, { year: { $lt: 2000 } }]} return all movies where the year is >= 1990 and < 2000.

### $in
#### {director: { $in: ["Lana Wachowski", "David Fincher", "Joel Coen"] } } return all movies where the director is in an array ["Lana Wachowski", "David Fincher", "Joel Coen"]

#### {year: { $in: [1980, 1990, 2000] } } return all movies where the value for year is in the $in array

#### {genre: { $in: ["Crime", "Drama"] } } return all movies where the genre array HAS any of the values in the $in array

### $nin
#### {year: { $nin: [1980, 1990, 2000] } } return all movies where the value for year is NOT in the $nin array

#### {genre: { $nin: ["Crime", "Drama"] } } return all movies where the genre array doesn't have ANY of the values in the $nin array

### $all
#### {genre: { $all: ["Crime", "Drama"] } } return all movies where the genre array has ALL of the values in the $all array
